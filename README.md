# Gower-distance

## What is Gowerâ€™s distance?

Suppose we have two observations $x_i = (x_{i1}, \dots, x_{ip})$ and $x_j = (x_{j1}, \dots, x_{jp})$, and we want a measure of how similar (or dissimilar) they are to each other. If each of the entries in these two vectors are quantitative (e.g., continuous variables), then we can use distance measures as a dissimilarity measure (e.g. Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance). How do we measure dissimilarity if instead of all numbers being numeric, some of them are binary/catagorical?
