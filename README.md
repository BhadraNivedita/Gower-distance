# Gower-distance

## What is Gowerâ€™s distance?

Suppose we have two observations $x_i = (x_{i1}, \dots, x_{ip})$ and $x_j = (x_{j1}, \dots, x_{jp})$, and we want a measure of how similar (or dissimilar) they are to each other. If each of the entries in these two vectors are quantitative (e.g., continuous variables), then we can use distance measures as a dissimilarity measure (e.g. Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance). How do we measure dissimilarity if instead of all numbers being numeric, some of them are binary/catagorical?

In this situation one can implement and generalised idea of similarity matrix know as Gower's distance. For each feature $k = 1, \dots, p$, we define a score $s_{ijk} \in [0,1]$. If $x_i$ and $x_j$ are close to each other along feature $k$, then the score $s_{ijk}$ is close to $1$. Conversely, if they are far apart along feature $k$ the score $s_{ijk}$ is close to $0$.
