# Gower-distance

## What is Gower’s distance?

Suppose we have two observations x_i = (x_{i1}, \dots, x_{ip}) and x_j = (x_{j1}, \dots, x_{jp}), and we want a measure of how similar (or dissimilar) they are to each other. If each of the entries in these two vectors are quantitative (i.e. take on real-number values), then we can use distance measures as a dissimilarity measure (e.g. Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance). But what if the p features that make up aren’t all numeric? What if some of them are categorical or binary?
